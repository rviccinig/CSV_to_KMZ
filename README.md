# CSV_to_KMZ


Problem: We need to create a KMZ layer that has data from a second database. This is specifically a GIS visualization problem.

Solution: In this case we were able to take all the traffic volumns and road databases and create a kmz layer that changes the width of roads depending of their traffic volume. We also created a KMZ that changes the Height of Calgary's wards depending of their Household 
Income. (Does not look that great)


Data: Data on this files is opensource coming from Statistics Canada, City of Calgary and the Government of Alberta.
